		Thinking is important: it’s how we make sense of the world and of new information. Thinking is also social: we build our ideas through our interactions with others. At <b>thinkinwords</b> we want to show students how to <i>think</i> about <i>thinking</i> and how to <i>think with other people</i>: a systematic approach to more effectively analyse and engage with the world around them.
		<br><br>
		By learning how to interrogate ideas — not just those of others, but their own as well — students can identify and probe the reasons that substantiate positions. Reasons should be valid and credible, but can be dubious and unjustified, and students can learn to categorically distinguish between these. Our programme sees these abilities of intellectual exploration and evaluation as an essential part of education.
		<br><br>
		We aim to put the focus back on the methodology — the systematic processes — of thought. Over our programme we want to create a safe and immersive thinking space that is distinct from the regular school environment. Here we will collaboratively examine content from a variety of disciplines and from the students’ own lives to create a community that thinks methodically, reflexively, and analytically.

	<p id="The_Programme">
		Our programme foregrounds the emergent knowledge generated through intensive collaboration: the classroom community can understand together what no one member would have managed on their own. While we will be facilitating and monitoring through the sessions, our pedagogic design is non-didactic by design so as to let students learn through participation and, crucially, create a metacognitive understanding on their own terms.<br><br>
		The programme uses collaborative and constructively antagonistic argumentation in combination with different modes of participation to create environments for specific thinking exercises. The students will be speaking, listening, writing, reading, debating, and discussing individually, in pairs or groups, and as a class, corresponding to the abilities whose development is being targeted.<br><br>
		Our content will draw from public discourse to cover how we address policy and controversy as well as popular fiction to accessibly analogise complex philosophical issues. To authentically reflect the interests and experiences of the students while still broadening their horizons, our programme will also use examples from their lives to generate discussion. <br><br>
		We want our programme to be detached from the stresses of the school system, so we will be avoiding textbook content and performance testing. Instead, we will be generating baseline and end-of-programme reviews of the students’ abilities and interests through auto-diagnostic activities and our classroom observations. Our session plans are designed to flexibly accommodate the conclusions of our monitoring as well as feedback from students.<br>

		At the end of our programme, we believe students will better understand their process of thinking, and appreciate how that understanding can be used to think incisively in different situations. This will equip students to engage with argumentation faster and more accurately, making them more comfortable with both explaining themselves and responding to the views of others.<br><br>
		This has direct implications for students’ academic life. In the short term, this translates to greater efficiency in reading to identify the specific answers for questions, and clearer written responses; this is of particular use when faced with unfamiliar questions, in examinations or otherwise. In the long term, we think this will help students adapt to the challenging intellectual environment of higher education where such thinking is demanded as a matter of course.

	<h1 id="About_Us_Heading">About Us</h1>
	<p id="About_Us">
		We are Apoorv Avram and Aditya Sarin.<br><br>
		Apoorv studied at Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, St. Stephen’s
		College, and is currently pursuing an MA in Education
		from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Aditya
		studied at The Shri Ram School, Ramjas College, and
		has an MA English with an interdisciplinary focus from
		the Manipal Centre for Philosophy and Humanities.<br><br>
		We have, between us, taught high school students at
		the Mallya Aditi International School and The Shri Ram
		School; edited textbooks for Frank Educational Aids
		and Good Luck Publishers; trained teachers at DPS
		Abohar for Kunskapsskolan; and designed, run, and
		taught at academic internships for undergraduates
		from across the country.<br><br>
		Most recently, we were both teaching undergraduates
		at Ashoka University how to write academically, with a
		view to improving their academic thinking.<br><br>
		Our combined disciplinary expertise underpins our
		research interest in the pedagogy of thought, and
		we intend to bring to this programme a composite of
		some of the most rigorously tested and academically
		exciting work from around the world on teaching
		thinking to students.<br>

				Thinking is important: it’s how we make sense of the
				world and of new information. Thinking is also social:
				we build our ideas through our interactions with
				others. At thinkinwords we want to show students
				how to think about thinking and how to think
				with other people: a systematic approach to more
				effectively analyse and engage with the world around
				them.
				<br><br>
				By learning how to interrogate ideas — not just
				those of others, but their own as well — students
				can identify and probe the reasons that substantiate
				positions. Reasons should be valid and credible, but
				can be dubious and unjustified, and students can
				learn to categorically distinguish between these.
				Our programme sees these abilities of intellectual
				exploration and evaluation as an essential part of
				education.
				<br><br>
				We aim to put the focus back on the methodology
				— the systematic processes — of thought. Over our
				programme we want to create a safe and immersive
				thinking space that is distinct from the regular school
				environment. Here we will collaboratively examine
				content from a variety of disciplines and from the
				students’ own lives to create a community that thinks
				methodically, reflexively, and analytically.
				</p>
				<br><br><br><br>
				<p id="Our Program">
				<b>Our programme</b> foregrounds the emergent
				knowledge generated through intensive
				collaboration: the classroom community can
				understand together what no one member would
				have managed on their own. To this end our
				pedagogical design is as non-didactic as possible,
				with class activities tailored towards generating
				metacognitive awareness through participation.
				We will facilitate these activities, but learnings must
				be student-generated: beliefs, even beliefs related
				to thinking, are intentional states, and can only be
				changed by students themselves.<br><br>
				The programme uses collaborative and constructively
				antagonistic argumentation in combination
				with different modes of participation to create
				environments for specific thinking exercises. The
				students will be speaking, listening, writing, reading,
				debating, and discussing individually, in pairs or
				groups, and as a class, corresponding to the abilities
				whose development is being targeted.<br><br>
				Our content will draw from public discourse to cover
				how we address policy and controversy as well as
				popular fiction to accessibly analogise complex
				philosophical issues. To authentically reflect the
				interests and experiences of the students while still
				broadening their horizons, our programme will also
				use examples from their lives to generate discussion. 
				<br><br>
				We want our programme to be detached from
				the stresses of the school system, so we will be
				avoiding textbook content and performance testing.
				Instead, we will be generating baseline and end-ofprogramme
				reviews of the students’ abilities and
				interests through auto-diagnostic activities and
				our classroom observations. Our session plans are
				designed to flexibly accommodate the conclusions of
				our monitoring, as well as feedback from students.

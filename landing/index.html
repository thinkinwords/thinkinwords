				Thinking is important: it’s how we make sense of the world and of new ideas. Thinking is also social: we build our ideas through our interactions with others. </p><p class="tiw" style="color: #00BBAA; font-size: 15px;">think</p><p class="tiw" style="color: #444444; font-size: 15px;">inwords_ </p><p class="intro"> is designed to show students how to <i>think about thinking</i> and how to <i>think with other people:</i> a systematic approach to more effectively analyse and engage with the world around them.<br><br>
				By learning how to interrogate ideas—not just those of others, but their own as well— students can identify the reasons that substantiate positions and go on to understand how to distinguish between valid and unjustified reasons. Our programme sees these abilities of intellectual exploration and evaluation as an essential part of education for every student.<br><br>
				We aim to put the focus back on the methodology—the systematic processes—of thought. Over the course of our programme we will work to create a safe and immersive thinking space that is distinct from the regular school environment. Here we will collaboratively examine content from a variety of disciplines and from the students’ own lives to create a community that thinks methodically, reflexively, and analytically.

			<h1>Our Approach</h1>
			<p class="approach">
				<br>
				Our programme foregrounds the emergent knowledge generated through intensive collaboration: the classroom community can understand together what no one member would have managed on their own. While we will be facilitating and monitoring during the sessions, our pedagogy is non-didactic by design, so as to let students learn through participation. Since classroom discussions do not always involve every student equally, our programme will work to accommodate different levels of comfort with discussion by ensuring the classroom community adjusts to provide every student meaningful opportunity to engage. This, crucially, allows students to create a metacognitive understanding on their own terms.<br><br>
				We want our programme to be detached from the stresses of the school system, so we will be avoiding textbook content and performance testing. Instead, we will be generating baseline and end-of-programme reviews of the students’ abilities and interests through auto-diagnostic activities and our classroom observations. Our session plans are designed to flexibly accommodate the conclusions of our monitoring as well as feedback from students.

			<h1>The Programme</h1>
			<p class="programme">
			<br>
				The objective of the programme is to develop the intuitive grasp of reasoning and engagement that students already have into a more explicit and precise set of tools. Specifically, the programme aims to address four major tool-sets with overlapping concerns: </p>
					<ul class="programme">
						<li>frameworks to break down and understand claims,</li>
						<li>the identification of arguments within conversational language,</li>
						<li>careful listening and direct engagement with the ideas of others, and</li>
						<li>working to organise and extend complex arguments.</li>
					</ul>
			<p class="programme">
				The programme uses collaborative and constructively antagonistic argumentation in combination with different modes of participation to create environments for specific thinking exercises. The students will be speaking, listening, writing, reading, debating, and discussing individually, in pairs or groups, and as a class, corresponding to the abilities whose development is being targeted, as well as their own interests and comfort.<br><br>
				Our content will draw from public discourse to cover how we address policy and controversy as well as popular fiction to accessibly analogise complex philosophical issues. To authentically reflect the experiences of the students while still broadening their horizons, our programme will also use examples from their lives to generate discussion.

			<h1>Impact</h1>
			<p class="Impact">
			<br>
				At the end of our programme, we believe students will better understand their process of thinking, and appreciate how that understanding can be used to think incisively in different situations. This will equip students to interface with argumentation faster and more accurately, making them more comfortable with both explaining themselves and responding to the views of others.<br><br>
				This has direct implications for students’ academic lives. In the short term, this translates to greater efficiency in reading to identify the specific answers for questions, and clearer written responses; this is of particular use when faced with unfamiliar questions, in examinations or otherwise. In the long term this will help students adapt to the challenging intellectual environment of higher education, especially in universities abroad, where such thinking is demanded as a matter of course.

			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<ul id="Faq" class="fa-ul">

					<li id="q1" onclick="showAnswer(a1, 'arrowQ1')"><i id="arrowQ1" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Aren’t schools already doing this? Why not do this from within the school framework?</li>

					<li id="a1">Curricular and examination pressures mean that schools have little time in which to equip students in these ways. Students feel that there is a great deal at stake in school, and so treat the subjects they are engaging with accordingly. The learning we are interested in requires a space in which, away from the other stresses of their academic lives, students feel free to make as many mistakes as they need in order to get better at thinking. It’s by actually doing the work of thinking together, rather than being lectured on how to do it, that students are likely to improve their thinking.</li>

					<li id="q2" onclick="showAnswer(a2, 'arrowQ2')"><i id="arrowQ2" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Wouldn’t this work best as a part of political science, or history, or something like that?
					</li>

					<li id="a2">Quite aside from the problems we discussed in the last question, there is a misapprehension that the study of particular disciplinary content will simultaneously or automatically generate frameworks for thought. Such an approach ensures that content is communicated and taught effectively, but that the process of thinking is largely ignored. Our programme sees the foregrounding of method as essential. To that end, we have curated a mix of content so that it never feels like a class on something, ensuring that thinking as a process remains the focus.
					</li>
 
					<li id="q3" onclick="showAnswer(a3, 'arrowQ3')"><i id="arrowQ3" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Won’t some of your material be controversial?
					</li>

					<li  id="a3">Among the resources we will be using as starting points for discussion will be issues that can be broadly categorised as ‘current affairs’, because these relate to positions and decisions in the public domain that affect all of us. Students are likely to have heard about these issues and have opinions of their own on them. This is useful because examining pre-existing beliefs allows new insight into how those were constructed in the first place. We recognise that such material can be polarising or controversial, but we also think that discussions about some such issues can be productive, and intend to carefully curate our material and our approach towards constructive ends. 
					</li>

					<li id="q4" onclick="showAnswer(a4, 'arrowQ4')"><i id="arrowQ4" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Why do you refer to the class as a “community”?
					</li>

					<li  id="a4">For a class to be a space in which ideas can be freely exchanged, a common set of values has to be established. We need students to trust themselves, and to listen to what others have to say. We want to create an atmosphere of intellectual equality and mutual respect—a space in which we can examine ideas and agree or disagree with each other without disparagement. Students need to feel accountable and responsible for their own words and positions, and this can only happen if they are part of a learning community with such values, engaged in a common pursuit.
					</li>

					<li id="q5" onclick="showAnswer(a5, 'arrowQ5')"><i id="arrowQ5" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Are you teaching critical thinking skills?
					</li>

					<li  id="a5">We think that there are a number of misapprehensions attached to that term, and so we prefer to avoid it. Our biggest problem is with calling thinking a ‘skill’. It may work like one, in that there are levels of proficiency to it and it is goal-oriented, but we don’t think it can be taught like one. This is because while thinking should be systematic, and can be approached in a structured manner, 'skill' teaching relies on the mimicry of good practice and the modularisation of processes that we have found does not address the nature of thinking effectively.
					</li>

					<li id="q6" onclick="showAnswer(a6, 'arrowQ6')"><i id="arrowQ6" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Are you teaching communication skills?
					</li>

					<li  id="a6">While this programme isn’t targeted only towards teaching students how to communicate, it will, of course, help in that regard: clear thinking should be the foundation of good communication. We believe that good communication is about more than confidence, charisma, or style. Being able to provide reasons for your positions as well as to organise your thoughts in such a manner that they might make sense to others are what make a set of views compelling to other people, and these are things that we will be working with students on.
					</li>

					<li id="q7" onclick="showAnswer(a7, 'arrowQ7')"><i id="arrowQ7" class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right " aria-hidden="true"></i>Is this a class on logic?
					</li>

					<li  id="a7">While we will talk about “reasons”, “structured thinking”, “premises and conclusions” and other terms that are common within the discipline of logic, our programme isn’t focused on formal argumentation. Engaging with thinking in everyday language is important and leaving the technicalities of formal logic aside helps with that.
